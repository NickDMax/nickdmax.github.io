<p>Ok – So I know what I am going to do. I am going to bootstrap this blog. That is right, I am going use this nascent blog to blog about the creation of this blog! More specifically I am going to use it to document the adventures I have while making it. Once it is done it will settle into a development and mathematics think-space. </p>

<p>My web development experience is a bit dated. On my bookshelf beside me, there is a book on DHTML where I believe the author talks about the wonders of VBScript. I did work for a CMS company and learned a few modern-at-the-time libraries like JQuery and Dojo but mostly I took other people’s designs and made them work within the CMS. </p>

<p>However, NodeJS has crossed my path by way of Visual Studio Code, an editor that I recently began to adopt to help me at work. VSCode is built atop a library called Electron, a desktop GUI framework, built upon Chromium and V8. It runs around a JavaScript environment called NodeJS.</p>

<p>I thought NodeJS was just a “little” scripting engine that some developers who, for whatever reason, didn’t want to learn a “real” server-side language. You know, they already use JavaScript in the browser, wouldn’t it be nice to just use it on the server?</p>

<p>WOW! I had/have a LOT to learn! There is a TON of power packed into that “little script” engine. 
So – let's start the adventure!</p>
