More specifically I am going to use it to document the adventures I have while making it. Once it is done it will settle into a development and mathematics think-space. \r\n\r\nMy web development experience is a bit dated. On my bookshelf beside me, there is a book on DHTML where I believe the author talks about the wonders of VBScript. I did work for a CMS company and learned a few modern-at-the-time libraries like JQuery and Dojo but mostly I took other people’s designs and made them work within the CMS. \r\n\r\nHowever, NodeJS has crossed my path by way of Visual Studio Code, an editor that I recently began to adopt to help me at work. VSCode is built atop a library called Electron, a desktop GUI framework, built upon Chromium and V8. It runs around a JavaScript environment called NodeJS.\r\n\r\nI thought NodeJS was just a “little” scripting engine that some developers who, for whatever reason, didn’t want to learn a “real” server-side language. You know, they already use JavaScript in the browser, wouldn’t it be nice to just use it on the server?\r\n\r\nWOW! I had/have a LOT to learn! There is a TON of power packed into that “little script” engine. \r\nSo – let's start the adventure!\r\n",
